# Getting Started

The UI Kit is a set of common components used across the entire Wand ecosystem.

The components for the most part are considered 'dumb' and just take input and display it. Rarely do they call any outside methods or functions.

The library relies on `@gig/magic-common` and therefore both should be installed before using a component from this library.

```bash
npm i @gig/magic-ui-kit @gig/magic-common
```

# Usage

To use a component from the UI Kit you must register the web components with the browser. To do so simply import the root of the package:

```javascript
import '@gig/magic-ui-kit';
```

You can also register individual components by importing directly from the `dist/components/{component-name}` folder. This is rarely useful though unless you are overriding specific components.

Once registered, the components work as any normal HTML element. Use the documentation for each component on the left side menu to find out more information.
